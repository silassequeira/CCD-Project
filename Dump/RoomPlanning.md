Pick a random profession. Then plan a detailed bedroom design for someone with that profession.

In your response:

1. Choose the profession and explain why certain items would be in their bedroom
2. Plan the room dimensions, wall placement, and architectural features
3. Decide on a color scheme and explain your choices
4. List at least 10 profession-specific objects that should be in the room
5. Consider the practical arrangement of furniture and items

Think step by step about room layout, object placement, and how the room reflects the person's professional identity.
